## Technical Implementation

### Backend Stack
- **NestJS** - API framework
- **TypeORM** - Database ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **Swagger** - API documentation

### Key Files
- `backend/src/contacts/contacts.controller.ts` - Contact API endpoints
- `backend/src/contacts/contacts.service.ts` - Business logic
- `backend/src/integrations/slack/slack.service.ts` - Slack commands
- `backend/src/database/entities/contact.entity.ts` - Contact model

### Database Schema
The `contacts` table includes:
- `tags` column (text array) - Stores all tags
- `leadScore` column (integer) - Lead quality score
- `status` enum - Lead lifecycle stage
- `source` enum - How the lead was acquired

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Slack commands not working**
- Verify Request URL is correct and accessible
- Check that signing secret is configured
- Ensure SSL certificate is valid

**Issue: Tags not persisting**
- Verify database connection
- Check TypeORM entity configuration
- Ensure migrations are run

**Issue: Analytics showing zero**
- Confirm you have contacts in the database
- Check workspace ID is correct
- Verify tag names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### API Testing

Use Postman or curl to test endpoints:

```bash
# Get analytics
curl -X GET https://your-api.com/api/v1/contacts/analytics/overview \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Add tags
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/v1/contacts/123/tags \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tags": ["high-ticket", "follow-up"]}'
```

## Performance Considerations

- Analytics queries are optimized with indexes on commonly filtered fields
- Tag filtering uses PostgreSQL array operations
- Consider caching analytics results for large datasets
- Slack commands timeout after 3 seconds - use background jobs for long operations

## Security

- All API endpoints require JWT authentication
- Slack requests verified with signing secret
- User permissions enforced at service layer
- SQL injection prevented by TypeORM parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
